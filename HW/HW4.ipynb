    "\n",
    "In this part, we will use PCA on some real dataset. \n",

    "Reuqirements:\n",
    "1. You should write your own code. You are not allowed to use `sklear.decomposition.PCA` command. (5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your solution should contain two functions. Function 1 takes data matrix X and integer k as inputs, and returns first k principal components. Function 2 takes data matrix X as input and a threshold $0\\leq\\eta\\leq1$ as inputs, and returns an integer k such that the first $k$ principal components (smallest) has explained variance ratio more than $\\eta$. **Your function should work for any data matrix X. In other words, you cannot use any global variable in your function.** (10 pts)\n",

Both matrix $A$ and vector $b$ are randomly generated by using `np.random`. The distribution of $A$ or $b$ can be either standard gaussian (`np.random.randn`) or uniform (`np.random.rand`). In other words, your function should allow four different choices, which are 1. gaussian $A$ and gaussian $b$, 2. gaussian $A$ and uniform $b$, 3. uniform $A$ and gaussian $b$, and 4. uniform $A$ and uniform $b$.
