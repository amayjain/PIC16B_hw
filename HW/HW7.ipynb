    "In the first model, you should use only the article title as an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second model, you should use only the article text as an input.\n",

    "In the third model, you should use both the article title and the article text as input.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. For the first two models, you don’t have to create new Datasets. Instead, just specify the inputs to the keras.Model appropriately, and Keras will automatically ignore the unused inputs in the Dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. When using the Functional API, it is possible to use the same layer in multiple parts of your model; see this [tutorial](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/) for examples. I recommended that you share a text vectorization layer and an embedding layer for both the article title and text inputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note: Do not use the shared embedding layer with separate text vectorization layers. If you do so, you will be embedding two different words on the same coordinate.\n",

    "\n",
    "You’re free to be creative when designing your models. If you’re feeling very stuck, start with some of the pipelines for processing text that we’ve seen in lecture, and iterate from there.
